# Agni-Flight-Computer-V2
Hi, this is Agni Flight Computer Version 2. This flight computer is designed only for Ground Control Station (GCS) purposes and is not used in the rocket because it runs on an Arduino Nano, which has limited processing power. However, if you want to use this flight computer for your rocket project, feel free to use it ðŸš€
